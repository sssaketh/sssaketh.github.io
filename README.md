    <P>Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the
        centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and
        intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most
        recognisable structures in the world</P>
    <p>The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[6] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest
        structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the
        Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title
        it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first
        structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height.</p>
    <h3 style="color: brown;">Notre Dame Cathedral </h3>

    <P class="diffcolour">Notre-Dame de Paris (French: [nɔtʁ(ə) dam də paʁi] (listen); meaning "Our Lady of Paris"), referred to simply as
        Notre-Dame,[a] is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité (an island in the Seine River), in the 4th
        arrondissement of Paris. The cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is considered one of the finest examples
        of French Gothic architecture. Several attributes set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style, particularly
        its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, and the
        naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration.[5] Notre Dame also stands out for its three pipe organs
        (one historic) and its immense church bells.[6]</P>
